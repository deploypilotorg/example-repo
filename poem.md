# A Moment in Time

## A Poem for Reflection

In the quiet moments between breaths,  
Where time stands still and memories rest,  
I find a peace that gently sets  
Like evening sun upon the west.

The world turns on its endless way,  
Stars above in silent keep,  
What was once the brightest day  
Now fades to dreams and gentle sleep.

Yet in code and in creation,  
In lines of text that shape our thoughts,  
We build with digital inspiration  
The future that we've always sought.

So here's to moments, brief but true,  
To words that last beyond our time,  
To changes small, but never few,  
That shape our path, one line at a time.
